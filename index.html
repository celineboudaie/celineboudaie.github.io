  <p>This is a simple blog to talk about the best foods/desserts in the LA area. I am a rising junior and just started my coding journey with Girls Who Code to make this website #sisterhood. I love swimming, biking, shopping, and most importantly Eating!</p>

      <h4><b>Macaron Ice Cream</b></h4>
      <p>I'm in love with these macaron ice cream sandwhiches from Milk. These come in many different flavors but my favorite has to be fruity pebbles. The store also offers single scoops of ice cream and I highly reccomend trying the red velvet.</p>

      <h4><b>Churro Ice Cream</b></h4>
      <p>This is one of my all time favorite desserts in LA. You have to be lucky to find this food truck around, the truck usually comes around to popular food events around the LA area. They have many different flavors of churros thats they place in creamy vanilla ice cream</p>

      <h4><b>In-N-Out</b></h4>
      <p>Honestly if I could reccomend going to one place it would definetly be In-N-Out. The cheese burgers and fries are so delicious and it is all served for a great price. The most popular thing is to add animal style to your burger or fries which is showed in the picture above. </p>

      <h4><b>Il Tramezzino</b></h4>
      <p>Best sandwhiches in LA. This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in LA because of their famous Chicken Special. This delicious sandwhich has a homemade creamy pesto sauce paninied with chicken and cheese. </p>
